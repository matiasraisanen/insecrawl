Insecam crawler. Downloads still frames from IP cameras listed on insecam.org

OPTIONS
═════════

-h, --help          Print this help page

-c, --country       Designate a country, and scrape stills from all cameras in 
                    that country. Provide a two letter country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)

-l, --listCountries Prints all countries, country codes and camera amounts listed on
                    insecam.org

-d, --details       Prints details for a given camera ID.

-f, --folder        Assign a custom download path under ./images folder.

-i, --identifier    Provide a custom identifier for the camera, used as 
                    filename for the saved image. Works only with -u and -o flags.

-o, --oneCamera     Provide a single insecam camera ID to download a still frame from.

-n, --newCamsOnly   Scrape only the cameras that do not have a still saved on disk.

--scrapeAllCameras  Downloads a still from every camera listed on insecam. This can 
                    take hours to complete. Best used together with --sortByCountry

-S, --sortByCountry Images will be saved in ./images/{COUNTRY_NAME}

--sortByCamera      A new folder will be created for each camera.

--interval          Used for running the script at set intervals. Provide an amount
                    of seconds you wish to wait between each run. Works only in 
                    conjuction with -c or --country. The interval starts to run after
                    the last camera is scraped, so don't expect exact results with 
                    this. Can be exited only with CTRL+C.

-t, --timeStamp     Append timestamp to image filename. Useful if you don't
                    want to overwrite previously saved images. Timestamp
                    format is [YYYY-MM-DD]_[HH-MM-SS], using computer's
                    local time and a 24h clock.

-u, --url           Provide a direct URL to a video stream to download a still frame 
                    from. Useful if the camera is no longer on insecam, but still 
                    has a publicly accessible web interface. Must be used in conjuction 
                    with -i or --identifier. 

-v, --verbose       Debug level logging
